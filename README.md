# CodeGraph

CodeGraph is an innovative debugging tool that uses graph 
database and AI to simplify on-call debugging in microservice 
architectures. By creating a comprehensive mapping of relationships between 
microservices down to the code level, CodeWeb
enables rapid root cause analysis and 
intelligent error tracing.

## üí° Solution

CodeGraph addresses the complexity of microservice debugging through a three-layered 
approach:

1. **Graph-Based Service Mapping**
   - Automatically scans and analyzes microservice ecosystem
   - Creates a directed graph representing service dependencies and interactions
   - Maps both direct (API calls) and indirect (message queue) relationships
   - Maintains versioned snapshots of service relationships over time

2. **Code-Level Relationship Tracking**
   - Parses source code to identify cross-service communication points
   - Maps specific functions and lines responsible for service interactions
   - Tracks configuration dependencies between services
   - Monitors changes in interface contracts and API versions

3. **AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis**
   - Leverages the graph structure to trace error propagation paths
   - Uses machine learning to identify common failure patterns
   - Provides context-aware debugging suggestions
   - Generates human-readable explanations of complex failure scenarios

4. **Real-Time Monitoring and Updates**
   - Continuously monitors service health and communication patterns
   - Updates the graph database as services evolve
   - Detects and flags potential breaking changes
   - Maintains historical context for debugging similar issues

This solution enables teams to:
- Reduce mean time to resolution for production incidents
- Understand the full impact of service changes before deployment
- Identify potential failure points in the service architecture
- Make data-driven decisions about service dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

CodeGraph consists of three main components:

1. **Graph Builder Engine**
   - Analyzes microservice codebases
   - Extracts dependency information
   - Constructs relationship graphs
   - Implements smart filtering logic

2. **Graph Database**
   - Stores service relationships
   - Maintains code-level connections
   - Enables fast traversal and querying
   - Supports real-time updates

3. **AI Debugging Agent**
   - Traces error paths through the graph
   - Provides context-aware error analysis
   - Generates human-readable explanations
   - Suggests potential fixes
